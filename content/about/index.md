&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a software developer with a background in engineering and mathematics. Coding and debugging has always stimulated my brain like no other, and after working a bit as a mechanical engineer, I decided that I’d rather spend the rest of my life in the world of software. Since then, I’ve continued to develop my skills and experiment with new technologies.
I prefer working in the backend and enjoy formulating complex SQL queries.

Lately I’ve been enjoying creating simple yet functional and aesthetic websites with Hugo.
