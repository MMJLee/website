I am a software developer with a background in engineering and mathematics. Coding and debugging has always stimulated my brain like no other, and after working a bit as a mechanical engineer, I decided that I’d rather spend the rest of my life in the world of software. Since then, I’ve continued to develop my skills and experiment with new technologies.  
&nbsp;

I prefer working in the backend and enjoy formulating complex SQL queries.  
&nbsp;

Lately I've been studying UI design and have learned that it's very hard to create a good design that isn't modern/minimalistic.

I’m experimenting with Hugo to create simple yet functional and aesthetic websites.
