I wanted to build a simple, performant blog to document things. This very website was the result of this, and it is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).

I'm currently looking into integrating [Decap](https://decapcms.org) using [GitLab](https://gitlab.com)'s [PKCE](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/oauth2.html#authorization-code-with-proof-key-for-code-exchange-pkce) for authentication. This will result in a serverless setup where content can be managed through an online UI, making it a cheap and easy-to-use solution to simple websites with CMS needs.
